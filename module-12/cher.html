                        Hello and welcome to my Web Development with HTML and CSS Module 12.3 Final. My name is Chee Her and I am in the Software Development 
                        Degree program at Bellevue University. I transferred from local technical college and started attending Bellevue University in the Fall Semester of 2021.

                                Playing the electric guitar is one of my favorite hobbies because it allows me to clear my mind.
                                I become completely focus on the music that I love. It distracts me from my everyday worries. Music brings joy to my life.

                                Movies are another hobby that I enjoy. I like to watch sci-fi movies. My reason for this is because it allows the creators to do anything they want.
                                Sci-fi movies can break any barrier that we currently understand here on Earth.

                                Swimming is another one of my favorite hobby which I do not get enough of. I do not have my own pool or live near a body of water. 
                                I can only swim when the opportunity presents itself. Although I am not the strongest swimmer, I can hold my own for a time if left in the middle of the ocean.

                                I served four years in the United States Marine Corps from 2009 to 2013. While in the service, my Military Occupation Specialist was Small Arms 
                                Repair/Technician (MOS 2111). I was deployed to Afghanistan in 2010 along with a second deployment in 2012 as part of Operation Enduring Freedom.

                                I got my associates degree in Software Developer in the fall of 2019 from my local technical college. This was the hardest part of my education 
                                as I knew little to nothing about computers. Towards the end of my second semester in the software developer program, something magically clicked 
                                in my head and I was able to understand everything I was doing. From then on, everything just went smoothly for me as I continued through the program.
